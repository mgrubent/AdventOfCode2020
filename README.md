# AdventOfCode2020
This repo is best thought of as my workbook.

It attempts to solve the Advent of Code 2020 problems as you might in an enterprise environment, or working on a team of multiple other people.

To that end:  
- Modularity and human-legibility is favored over one-liners
- Abstraction is used whenever it seems like the right move
- Libraries that already solve a problem well are brought in, regardless of their size
- `gradle` is a must, since it permeates industry
